Thats my collection of home-services IÂ´m hosting on a mini-pc running a K3s Kubernetes Cluster (one Node) 

# Preparing machine
install k3s (one-line-installation)
enable ssh
install open-scsi

# Cluster Infrastructure
## Longhorn (https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/tree/master/chart)
helm repo add longhorn https://charts.longhorn.io
helm repo update

helm install longhorn/longhorn --name longhorn --namespace longhorn-system

ATTENTION!: Dont delete the Namespace in case you want to delete Longhorn - there is an uninstall script.
